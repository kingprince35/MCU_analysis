MCU Analysis ðŸ“Š
Project Overview
This project is a comprehensive analysis of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) movies, focusing on financial performance, audience reception, and critic ratings. By analyzing key financial and critical metrics, this project aims to uncover patterns in MCU movie earnings, budget allocations, and feedback from both audiences and critics.

Features
Data Collection: Data was gathered from publicly available sources and includes key metrics such as movie budgets, gross income, audience and critic scores.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizations of movie revenue trends, budget allocation, and comparison of audience vs. critic ratings.
Hypothesis Testing: Statistical testing to explore relationships between variables (e.g., budget and worldwide gross).
Visualizations:
Yearly movie releases and revenue trends
Top 10 highest-grossing MCU movies
Audience vs. critics score distribution
Budget vs. gross revenue comparison
Success metrics by movie category
